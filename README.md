# Swagger generater study

Study [swagger-autogen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-autogen) which helps to generate swagger file.

I have tested with [express](https://expressjs.com/), it is fun!

Please run below command after you clone this repo:

> npm i
>
> npm run swagger-autogen

Then open your browser with this URL: http://localhost:3000/doc, you will see a nice Swagger console and allow you to test the API. At the same time it generate [swagger_output.json](./swagger_output.json) which is the swagger we want.
